# pic16f630_CarClock

This repository contains the code for a PIC16F630 microcontroller driving a single step motor to behave like a clock.

The single step motor should be a VID-69 or a compatible motor like BKA30C-R5.

I am using the Microchip MPLIB X IDE v6.16 with the Microchip XC8 v2.45 C compiler. For programming, I am using a Pickit 3 clone as programmer.
